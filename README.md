# Static Site Generator

This program generates static HTML pages from Markdown files. Running the main function generates HTML pages from the markdown files found in the content folder, and copies them and the files from the static folder into the public folder.

Generate the pages and start the server with main.sh or `python src/main.py` and `python server.py --dir public`.
